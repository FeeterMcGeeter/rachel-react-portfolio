                    Having had the opportunity to work closely with Rachel for
                    more than two years, I can say without hesitation that she
                    stands out among the broader DSS team with her willingness
                    to remain curious and to bring forth ideas that make all of
                    us more effective and more efficient. Her natural abilities
                    to think strategically and to challenge the status-quo are
                    an asset to the DSS team and make her capable of leading any
                    DSS initiative. I have also witnessed firsthand the respect
                    that Rachel's expertise commands on the Blue Sky Region
                    floor. No matter whether the focus is on supply chains,
                    e-commerce, international shipping, or FedEx resources,
                    Rachel brings a wealth of knowledge to the DSMs and AEs that
                    depend on her. The true impact of her new-hire education
                    initiative is likely underappreciated and certain to be
                    long-lasting.

                <p className='one-letter mb-sm'>
                    In a more personal capacity, Rachel has not been shy showing
                    her enthusiasm for helping others. Particularly those in
                    need. It becomes most apparent each December as she leads
                    the Blue Sky Region's involvement with the Angel Tree
                    project. The energy she puts into it permeates the Blue Sky
                    Region with a deep sense of gratitude. Being part of that
                    each year is one of the highlights for me, personally.

                <p className='one-letter mb-sm'>
                    I will continue to expect great things from Rachel and look
                    forward to working with her for many more years to come at
                    FedEx!
